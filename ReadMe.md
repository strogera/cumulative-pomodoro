# Cumulative Pomodoro
* Not really pomodoro but with the same 25/5 work to break time ratio.
* A simple android app to trace your work hours and make sure you are getting enough break time. 
* Sometimes strict set hour constraints are hard to be followed because you are "in the zone", especially when programming. So instead, your break time can differ depending on the time you spent working using the same pomodoro ratio.
